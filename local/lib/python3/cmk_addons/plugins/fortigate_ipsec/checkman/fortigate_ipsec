description:
 This check monitors the status of FortiGate IPsec VPN tunnels via the FortiOS REST API.
 It evaluates the phase2 proxy objects returned by /api/v2/monitor/vpn/ipsec, including their
 state, source/destination selectors, and per-proxy byte counters. The service summary reports
 remote gateway, tunnel type/port, connection counts, and aggregates RX/TX statistics.
metrics:
 - fortigate_ipsec_rx_bandwidth: Received bandwidth (B/s)
 - fortigate_ipsec_tx_bandwidth: Transmitted bandwidth (B/s)
